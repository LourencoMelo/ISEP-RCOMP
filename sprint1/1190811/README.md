I am trying to find a place to settle the IC to provide fully the building.In the some rooms there was a need to install cable race ways to locate outlets in the middle of the rooms.##Ground Floor* Total area: 1200 m^2 (60x20)* 20.1- 5x2,5 = 12,5 m^2 (4 outlets)* 20.2- 10x5 = 50 m^2 (10 outlets)* 20.3 - 10x7,5 = 75 m^2 (15 outlets)* 20.4 - 5x20 = 100 m^2 (20 outlets)* WC - 12,5 m^2To Grant more outlets to end-users will be added some more outlets in some rooms compared to the minimum outlets.Area that isn't rooms and WC´s:Area: 1200 - 262,5 = 937,5 m^2### HCOne HC by floor with maximum 1000 m^2. We have 1200 m^2, so it will be needed to have 2 HC to facilitate cable management between rooms. Every time that the HC is really close to CP, everything is inside of a closet. This HC could be in another room but it was determined this way to don't ocupy a lot of space in other rooms.### CPThe CP'S in this floor are located near the HC's and in rooms that can decrease the amount of cables to other areas.### APThe AP's on this floor were strategically located to offer Wi-Fi to every cliente in every room possible on the floor. (Empresarial rate in this AP)### Technique for cable managementThe main clables must pass underground## First Floor* Total area: 1200 m^2 (60x20)* 21.1 - (5x5) = 25 m^2 (6 outlets)* 21.2/3/4/5 - (10x5) = 50 m^2 (11 outlets)* 21.6/7/8 - (10X6) = 60 m^2 (12 outlets)* 21.9 - 15x5 = 105 m^2 (28 outlets)* 21.10/11- (13x5) = 65 m^2 (13 outlets)To Grant more outlets to end-users i am thinking about to add some more outlets in each room.Area that isn't rooms and WC´s:Area:  1200 - 640 = 560 m^2 ### HCOne HC by floor. We have 1200 m^2, so i will think if we need to have 2 HC to facilitate cable management between rooms. Every time that the HC is really close to CP, everything is inside of a closet.### CPThe CP'S in this floor are located near the HC's and in rooms that can decrease the amount of cables to other areas, or areas where was a high density of outlets.### APThe AP's on this floor were strategically located to offer Wi-Fi to every cliente in every room possible on the floor. (Business type of AP)### Technique for cable managementThe space over the dropped ceiling is perfect to install cable raceways, placed 2.5 meters from the ground. The ceiling height on this floor is 3 meters.## Cables measurment* [Cabbles Ground Floor](Cabbles1/Cabbles1.md)* [Cabbles First Floor](Cabbles2/Cabbles2.md)## Inventory### Ground Floor* 1 IC* 2 HC's * 2 CP's* 2 AP's* 65 outlets* 144 meters Fiber cabble* 897 meters Copper cabble (CAT6)* 75 Patch Coords* 3 Switchs 24 ports * 1 Switch 48 ports* 3 Patch Panels 24 ports* 1 Patch Panel 48 ports### First Floor* 2 HC's* 5 CP's* 2 AP's* 142 outlets* 57 meters Fiber cabble* 2112 meters Copper cabble (CAT6)* 144 Patch Coords* 4 Switch 48 ports* 1 Switch 24 ports* 4 Patch Panels 48 ports* 1 Patch Panel 24 ports
