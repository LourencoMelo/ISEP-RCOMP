The amount of copper cable bought should be more than the necessary in case of small errors in calculations or in case of any accident while structuring cables.| ||  Fibre cables  |  5 cables    |  Number of cables necessary.     ||  Copper cables  |   504 cables   |  Number of cables necessary.     |## CablingThe cable we are using is CAT6 RJ45. There are more type of cables but also more expensive. In this Sprint, CAT6 RJ45 is perfect. In the entire project it has the T568A pattern.
