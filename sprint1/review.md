RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 review=========================================### Sprint master: 1190811 ###(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)# 1. Sprint's backlog #	In the first week the team just calculated the area of the respective buildings floors. On the next week it was been planned what type o cables to use and what strategies that would be done in this Sprint. At the time all the meetings were done to plan all things that were going to be implemented. Each member started to watch the specifics of his floors that he was responsible. In the same week every position/quantity of MC, IC and HC and CP and AP was thought. In the remaing days all values were confirmed and stratagies to complete the Sprint in a successfuly way.# 2. Subtasks assessment #(Examples)## 2.1. 1190782 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. #### Totally implemented with no issues. ####### 1. (Note) The cabble measurements could be more precise## 2.2. 1190811 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 2; Scrum Master. #### Totally implemented with no issues. ####### 1. (Note) The first HC on the ground floor located in the building could be in another room.## 2.3. 1191419 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 3. #### Totally implemented with no issues.  ####### 1. (Note) Copper cables measures can be a bit off the real value due to the program used (Paint).## 2.4. 1190718 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 4. #### Totally implemented with no issues. ####### 1. (Note) Small calculation mistakes: Total length of copper cables and optical fibre may be displaced from the actual value needed due to the used program for that task.#### 2. (Note) Cps could be placed in a larger number and in more strategic positions.# Inventory of the project* Fiber optics: 2260,5 m* Cooper : 19709 m* MC: 1* IC: 4* HC: 14* AP: 23* CP: 23* Outlet: 1292* Switch: 26 (48 ports)* Patch pannel: 26 (48 ports)* Switch: 24 (24 ports)* Patch pannel: 24 (24 ports)* Cooper cables: 1348 * Fiber cables: 31
