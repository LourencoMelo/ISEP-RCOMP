OSPF dynamic routing-> Static routing will no longer be used, so on every router, the existing static routing tables were   erased;   -> The OSPF was established at Building 3 router (code shown) and in all routers. Area 3 was the area id chosen for building 3.* router ospf 3* log-adjacency-changes* network 10.122.224.0 0.0.0.127 area 0 * network 10.122.229.0 0.0.0.63 area 3* network 10.122.229.64 0.0.0.63 area 3* network 10.122.229.128 0.0.0.63 area 3* network 10.122.228.0 0.0.0.255 area 3* network 10.122.229.192 0.0.0.63 area 3## 2.

VoIP service-> In each building there are 2 phones, one in the ground floor and other in the firt floor. Both phones comunicate between their building and all other buildings. For this building we have phone : 3000 and phone : 3001.* dial-peer voice 10 voip* destination-pattern 1...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.1* dial-peer voice 20 voip* destination-pattern 2...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.4* dial-peer voice 40 voip* destination-pattern 4...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.2* telephony-service* max-ephones 2* max-dn 2* ip source-address 10.122.229.193 port 2000* auto assign 1 to 2* ephone-dn 1* number 3000* ephone-dn 2* number 3001![tele3.svg](tele3.svg)## 6.
