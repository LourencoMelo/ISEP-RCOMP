OSPF dynamic routing-> Static routing will no longer be used, so on every router, the existing static routing tables were   erased, with the exception of the default route established in this building router;   -> The OSPF was established at Building 1 router (code shown) and in all routers. Area 1 was the area id chosen for building 1.* router ospf 1* log-adjacency-changes* network 10.122.224.0 0.0.0.127 area 0* network 10.122.225.0 0.0.0.63 area 1* network 10.122.225.64 0.0.0.63 area 1* network 10.122.225.128 0.0.0.31 area 1* network 10.122.224.128 0.0.0.127 area 1* network 10.122.225.160 0.0.0.31 area 1## 2. HTTP servers-> A new server was added to the local DMZ network , with a manually set IPv4 address. The following HTML page is the one implemented :![ze.svg](ze.svg)## 3.
