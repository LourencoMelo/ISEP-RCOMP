OSPF dynamic routing-> Static routing will no longer be used, so on every router, the existing static routing tables were   erased;   -> The OSPF was established at Building 2 router (code shown) and in all routers. Area 2 was the area id chosen for building 2.* router ospf 2* log-adjacency-changes* network 10.122.224.0 0.0.0.127 area 0* network 10.122.227.0 0.0.0.63 area 2* network 10.122.226.128 0.0.0.127 area 2* network 10.122.226.0 0.0.0.127 area 2* network 10.122.227.128 0.0.0.15 area 2* network 10.122.227.64 0.0.0.63 area 2## 2. HTTP servers-> A new server was added to the local DMZ network , with a manually set IPv4 address. The following HTML page is the one implemented :![lolas.svg](lolas.svg)## 3.

VoIP service-> In each building there are 2 phones, one in the ground floor and other in the firt floor. Both phones comunicate between their building and all other buildings. For this building we have phone : 2000 and phone : 2001.* ial-peer voice 10 voip* destination-pattern 1...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.1* dial-peer voice 30 voip* destination-pattern 3...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.3* dial-peer voice 40 voip* destination-pattern 4...* session target ipv4:10.122.224.2* telephony-service* max-ephones 2* max-dn 2* ip source-address 10.122.227.65 port 2000* auto assign 1 to 2* ephone-dn 1* number 2000* ephone-dn 2* number 2001![tele2.svg](tele2.svg)## 6.
