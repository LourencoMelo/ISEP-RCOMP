RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1190782 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
In the follow out of sprint one, the team is now required to create a network simulation matching the developed structured cabling project. In this sprint the focus is on the layer two infrastructure, and the layer three fundamentals (IPv4 addressing, and static routing).

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues

# 3. Subtasks assignment #

1190782 :

* Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer Simulation for building 1.
* Campus backbone connection.
* Development of planning.md file and project tasks coordination.
* Ensure the compatibility between different building's Packet Tracer Simulation.

1190811 :

* Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer Simulation for building 2.
* Putting together into a single Packet Tracer simulation all simulations created by every team member.

1191419 :

* Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer Simulation for building 3.

1190718 :

* Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer Simulation for building 4.

# 4. Final individual review #

1190782 :

* Partially implemented with no issues
> During the implementation of the Static Firewall (ACLs) we had some troubles with previous implementations. Thus we 
>removed the  Static Firewall (ACLs) part.
