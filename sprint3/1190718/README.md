OSPF dynamic routing-> Static routing will no longer be used, so on every router, the existing static routing tables were   erased;   -> The OSPF was established at Building 4 router (code shown) and in all routers. Area 4 was the area id chosen for building 4.* router ospf 4* log-adjacency-changes* network 10.122.224.0 0.0.0.127 area 0* network 10.122.231.128 0.0.0.63 area 4* network 10.122.231.64 0.0.0.63 area 4* network 10.122.231.0 0.0.0.63 area 4* network 10.122.230.0 0.0.0.255 area 4* network 10.122.231.192 0.0.0.31 area 4## 2.
